Example

input:

print(menu_select("Please select your option","option #1","option #2","option #3","option#4"))

output:

Please select your option:
(1) option #1
(2) option #2
(3) option #3
(4) option#4
Please type the number corosponding to your selection:

if the selects one of the options, its returned, so if the user inputed 1 here, it would output 1

returns entered number while checking to make sure it fits the paramaters set 

If you want to be fancy with it, and have the user create their own menu, you can do print(menu_select(input("message: "),input("paramater 1: "),input("paramater 2: "),input("paramater 3: "),input("paramater 4: ")))
