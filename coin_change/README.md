# Name of the project
# Coin Change Program

## Project Description
# The Coin Change Program is a tool that calculates the minimum number of coins required to make up a given amount of money using a greedy algorithm.
# Users can select a country, and the program will load the corresponding coin denominations (USD, GBP, CAD, EUR, MXN).
# This project aims to assist with making change in various currencies, with denominations stored in text files specific to each country.

## Installation
---
# 1. Clone the repository or download the project files from GitHub.
# 2. Ensure you have the "Helper functions" folder downloaded from this GitHub repository (if not downloading the entire project):
#    [https://github.com/MarkBishopUcas/CP2-PROJECTS](https://github.com/MarkBishopUcas/CP2-PROJECTS)
#    Ensure that the "Helper functions" folder is located in the same directory as the "coin_change" folder, but **NOT inside it**.
# 3. Make sure Python 3.7 or higher is installed on your system.
# 4. Install any required dependencies by running the following command:
#    `pip install os`

## Execution and Usage
---
# To run the project, execute the `main.py` script. The program will prompt you to select a country and input a target amount of money for coin change calculation.
# Afterward, it will display the minimum number of coins needed, along with their names.
* Start the program by running `main.py`.
* Select a country for the coin denominations.
* Enter the target amount you want to make change for.
* The program will display the minimum number of coins required and the specific coins used.

## Used Technologies
---
* **Python** - The primary programming language used to implement the program's logic and user interface.
  `pip install python`
* **os** - Used for handling file operations, such as loading coin denominations from text files.
  `pip install os`
* **helper functions** - A custom set of utility functions that assist with the program's operation (e.g., menu selection).
  `pip install helper_funcs`

## Current Features
---
* Supports multiple countries' coin denominations (USA, UK, Canada, EU, Mexico).
* Uses a greedy algorithm to calculate the minimum number of coins required for a given amount.
* Interactive menu system for selecting countries and entering amounts.
* Handles various currencies with appropriate denominations stored in country-specific text files.
