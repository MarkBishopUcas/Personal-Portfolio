# Portfolio of Python Projects

## Project Description

This portfolio contains a collection of small Python projects that demonstrate different functionalities. These projects include a battle simulator, a change calculator, a Morse code translator, a personal library program, a random password generator, and a to-do list manager. Each project serves as an opportunity to showcase problem-solving skills, working with user input, implementing algorithms, and leveraging external libraries.

## Installation
---
1. Download the whole GitHub repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using:
   `pip install inquirepy`

## Execution and Usage
---
This project features a main menu to choose from various individual programs. To start the program, simply execute the `main.py` file. Upon running, the user will be presented with a list of options.
* Battle simulator: Simulate a battle between characters with stats and random events.
* Change calculator: Enter an amount and let the program calculate the change needed using different denominations.
* Morse code translator: Convert text into Morse code and vice versa.
* Personal library program: Manage and search a collection of books.
* Random password generator: Generate a secure password based on specified parameters.
* To-do list: Track and manage personal tasks.


## Used Technologies
---
* Python - The primary language for all projects in this portfolio.
`pip install python`

* InquirePy - Used for creating interactive CLI menus for user input.
`pip install inquirepy`

* Random - Python's built-in library for generating random numbers, used in the random password generator and battle simulator.

* Time - Python's built-in module for working with time, used to manage time in the todo list manager. 

## Current Features
---
* A main menu to select between different projects and applications.
* A battle simulator with randomly generated events and character stats.
* A change calculator that determines the optimal combination of coins for a given amount.
* A Morse code translator that converts both text to Morse code and vice versa.
* A personal library manager to keep track of books, with the ability to search by title or author.
* A random password generator that creates secure passwords of a specified length and complexity.
* A to-do list manager to track tasks, set priorities, and mark tasks as completed.
